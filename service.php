We are one of the very few centres in the country to use lasers for conducting these safe and sophisticated treatments. <br>Laser Dentistry can be a precise and effective way to perform many dental procedures (preferably Soft Tissues). Procedures performed using soft tissue dental lasers may not require any injections, sutures (stitches) and medicines (almost). Certain Laser Dentistry procedures do not require anesthesia also. Laser dentistry minimizes bleeding because the high-energy light beam aids in the coagulation (clotting) of exposed blood vessels, thus inhibiting blood loss. <br> Dental Surgeons dealing with this kind of treatments are known as Laser Dental Specialists. <br> <br>

If they erupt smoothly and without any interruption, then they can be proved as an asset. But the problem with third molars is that in case they do not erupt properly or are misaligned, they would need to be extracted. If they are poorly aligned, then they can damage the adjacent tooth.

          ... solution, for replacing your missing tooth/teeth. They have definitely changed the course of dentistry in the last quarter of a century or so. <br> A dental implant is basically a titanium post which is surgically inserted into the jawbone beneath the gum line to work as a tooth root. Post insertion, an implantologist will attach a crown on top of the implant to ensure the appearance of a natural tooth. <br> Tooth Implants not only look and feel like your natural teeth but also function like them. <br> Prosthodontics is the dental specialty that treats patients with missing or deficient teeth. Prosthodontic procedures include crowns, bridges, veneers, inlays, onlays, complete and partial dentures. Dental implants have become the preferred method for replacing missing teeth, so many prosthodontic procedures today are done with implants as the support instead of the natural teeth or gums. Specialist Dental Surgeons dealing with this kind of treatments are known as Prosthodontists. <br> &emsp13;A dental implant is an artificial tooth root that is placed into your jaw to hold a replacement tooth or bridge. Dental implants may be an option for people who have lost a tooth or teeth due to periodontal disease, an injury, or some other reason. Dental implants are metal posts or frames that are surgically positioned into the jawbone beneath your gums. Once in place, they allow your dentist to mount replacement teeth onto them. No matter your age, if you have a missing tooth or more, implant can restore your ability to chew and smile with confidence. Specialist Dental Surgeons dealing with this kind of treatments are known as Implantologists. <br> &emsp13;The above specialised sectors of dentistry arerequired for Missing tooth / teeth in one arch or both thearches as well as when all teeth are missing (complete Edentulous). <br> <br>
